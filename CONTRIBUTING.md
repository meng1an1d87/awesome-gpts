# Contributing Guidelines

## The pull request should have a useful title. Pull requests with `Update readme.md`will not be appreciated. Please carefully read everything in `Adding to this list`.

# Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Chose corresponding section (Education/Productivity/etc.) for your suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[GPT Name](GPT link): "One line description...." "by" [Creator Name](Creator Profile Link such as Github/X/LinkedIn)`
- Use the following format for commit message: `Add GPT_Name (Under Category_Name)` 
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- List your GPT at the end of that category.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the GPT (additionally recommended to include a link to the social media post about it).

# Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, maintainers of this awesome repo will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-repo guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
